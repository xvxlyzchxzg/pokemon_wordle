# pokemon_wordle

Hello! This is project #1 of my portfolio, and like the title implies, this is a pokemon wordle. 

How it works: 
- The answer is a pokemon game, and the user gets 6 attempts.
- If the letter is correct and in the correct position, the block will turn green
- If the letter is correct but in the wrong position, the block will turn yellow
- If the letter is not in the word, the block will turn grey 

After each wrong guess, the web will reveal a part of the Pokemon's sprite 
After 3 wrong guesses, the web will show the pokemon typing (e.g. Grass, Fire, Dark) 


Do try it out for yourself!
